                    Hello, I'am Jerome, I want to become a front-end developer and hopefully to become a full-stack developer. I graduated 
                    in Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from last June 2023. I got interested in web development when I took my OJT
                    for my college credits. After OJT, I studied the basics of web development, HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. But it didn't last long 
                    because I prioritized my university studies. I resumed my learning of web developemnt last June 2023 after i graduated. I learned the basics
                    of front-end and back-end development, i learned API's, some basic authentication, and frameworks like Bootstrap and React. I build projects but 
                    not production ready because I really don't have an experience for that, but projects only for my portfolio and to practice my skills.
